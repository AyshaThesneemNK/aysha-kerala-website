    <h4>Ezhimala</h4></br>
<p>Ezhimala Beach is one of the famous and oldest beaches of Kerala, something around 55 km from Kannur. Lined with myriad swaying palm grooves and surrounded with coconut trees, the beach has a unique beauty to it. The destination is visited by thousands of tourists and holidaymakers and beach lovers each year and is known for the serenity surrounding it. The sunset and sunrise views here are actually to die for! No kidding! People come here to witness the views which are also perfect for photo enthusiasts. Another gorgeous part of this beach are the scattered sculptured stone pillars all over, which look remarkable. The little hillock surrounded with the sea is just what everyone dreams of when thinking about relaxing. The term Ezhimala is the combination of two words 'ezhu' meaning &lsquo;seven&rsquo; and 'mala' meaning &lsquo peaks. This place is also rich with medicinal plants and herbs and is always a point of research for many.</p>
