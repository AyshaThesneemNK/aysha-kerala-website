    <h4>Muthanga wildlife sanctury</h4></br>
<p>Established in 1973, the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary is contiguous to the protected area network of Nagarhole and Bandipur of Karnataka on the north east and Mudumalai of Tamil Nadu on the southeast. Rich in bio-diversity, the sanctuary is an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The management lays emphasis on scientific conservation with due consideration for the general lifestyle of the tribals and others who live in and around the forest region. The Sanctuary has a large population of pachyderms and has been declared a Project Elephant site.

    Elephants roam freely here and tigers are sighted occasionally as well. Various species of deer, monkeys and birds also live here. The Reserve is also home to a profusion of birds, butterflies and insects. The trees and plants in the sanctuary are typical of the south Indian moist deciduous forests and semi-evergreen forests. A drive along the road to Muthanga and further offers chances to watch these roaming animals. Elephant rides can be arranged by the Forest Department.</p>
