    <h4>Cheruthoni dam</h4>
    </br>
    <p>An ideal picnic spot situated in the Idukki District of Kerala, the Cheruthoni Dam being 138 m tall is the largest concrete gravity dam close to the Idukki Arch Dam. Constructed across the Periyar River, this third highest dam in the country was built in 1976 as a part of the Idukki Hydroelectric project along with two other dams namely Kulamavu and Idukki.

        The dam is looked after by the Kerala State Electricity Board and also rents out boats to engage in the two-hour cruise between Kulamavu and Idukki. On the way, visitors are spellbound by the beauty that this place offers and the enchanting views of the sunrise and sunset that one gets to experience from here. From the great height at which the Cheruthoni Dam is situated, one can view certain parts of the Kochi city on a clear day. However, one can reach the dam only by walking or via a jeep.</p>
