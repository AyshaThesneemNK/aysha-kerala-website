    <h4>Vyshali cave</h4>
</br>
    <p>ve.
        Movies and locations leave lasting impression in our minds. And today, we are going to go back in time and tell you the story of how a small cave near Idukki dam holds a unique place in the Malayali… psyche – all thanks to Vaishali, a movie that hit the screens in 1988. …
        
        Idamalayaar is a perfect place for a breath taking view of the reservoir and the “Vaisali” caves. Major attraction is Dam, Reservoir and the vaisali caves (Where vaisali film shoot here) You have to go 2.5 Km uphill to see the cave created from solid rock during the british ruling period. Only a 4WD vehicle can go to the top of hill, Don’t try with your sedan. Only one village restaurant available there with Team and some snacks with a Great taste that you will never get from anywhere else. Approach road to the dam is quite old but its okay for travel. You will never miss the clouds and falling rock mountain on the way to dam. </p>
