    <h4>Revi karunakaran meusium</h4>
</br>
    <p>Mr. Revi Karunakaran will always be remembered for his passion and the massive role he played in improving the coir industry in Kerala. The museum built to showcase his art collection stands testament to a man with a fine eye and love for a multitude of art forms. The museum is among the primary attractions in Alappuzha. The ivory and crystal collections are among the largest of its kind. A collection of Tanjore paintings shine brightly on its catalogue along with a 200 sq. ft. mural made completely from vegetable dyes. Its special 'Kerala Room' has over 3800 unique pieces that chart the growth and evolution of our culture. It is an establishment that embodies a love for art and all that is relevant to our culture</p>
